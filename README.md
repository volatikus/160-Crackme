# 160ä¸ªcrackme

Try to analyze each crackme one by one starting from the first one.

Each crackme is a separate folder

The folder contains the following contents

1. Detailed analysis process of the program (md format and pdf format) If you download the md format, you must download it together with the assert folder (the markdown format can be downloaded in Typora to view)
2. udd and idb files
3. Source target program and dll required to run the target program
4. Cracked program
5. Registration machine source code and exe

Finally, I attach my own CSDN blog: https://blog.csdn.net/qq_38474570
